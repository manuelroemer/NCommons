# Welcome to the NCommons Documentation!

This page hosts the public documentation for the [NCommons](https://github.com/manuelroemer/NCommons)
libraries.

NCommons is a set of several .NET libraries which provide common building blocks that can be used
by any kind of library or application. 

You can learn more about NCommons on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuelroemer/NCommons).

The documentation is automatically generated using the XML documentation comments from the source
code of the most recent package release.
Even though no hand-written articles are available, a lot of time is spent on writing the
XML documentation comments.
Reading through them is certainly going to be worth your time.

You can start browsing the documentation by clicking [this link](https://manuelroemer.github.io/NCommons/api)
or by clicking the _API Documentation_ link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

If you have any issues, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuelroemer/NCommons/issues/new).
